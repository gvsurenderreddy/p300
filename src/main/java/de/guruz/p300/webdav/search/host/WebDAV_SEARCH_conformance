Support of the WebDAV SEARCH standard in p300
---------------------------------------------
Sebastian Breier, Seba_B@gmx.net, 2008-09-12, v1.0

p300 supports WebDAV SEARCH as specified in [1].
However, support is not complete.
Here is a list of differences to the standard (hopefully most of them) and a couple of other important things.

- No Query Schema Discovery
- Only basicsearch Grammar
- Search arbiter is ignored

Queries
-------
- Only support for "select", "from" and "where" elements
- "select" must contain "allprop"
- "from" must contain "scope"
- "scope" must contain both "href" and "depth"
- "href" must contain "/shares/"
- "depth" must contain "infinity"
- "where" must contain an "eq" element
- "eq" must contain both a "prop" and a "literal" element
- "prop" must contain "displayname"
- "literal" is the search keywords

Replies
-------
- Replies should conform to WebDAV SEARCH
- Reply "href" element will always be an URL relative to the search host
- If a reply element is a directory, it will have "contentlength" of 0 and an associated "resourcetype" of "collection"
